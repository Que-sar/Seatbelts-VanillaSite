# Multi-page Website for University assignment. 

## It consists of multiple (all fully responsive) pages (6), with secure login through myPhPAdmin to a mySQL server (LAMP Stack) with cookie functionality and stylish moving background.

### The band the site is about is called SEATBELTS, they created the legendary jazz fusion music for the popular series "Cowboy Bebop" (1998-1999), this also serves as a tribute towards the series as it tries to give the same emotions.

The frontend is made in HTML, CSS(and Bootstrap), Javascript(and JQuery), with the backend being in PHP.

The main landing page, about page, login, music and profile pages use AJAX to improve on loading times and customer-experience.
Every line was written in care with security on mind, (for example with: careful salting, filtering and loading or connections, error handling).
Cookie functionality was also implemented for GDPR reasons.

## Setting the site up

Without a backend, the commands are:

sudo php -S localhost:8000

this starts the server and enables to look through the basic functionality.
